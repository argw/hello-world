# hello-world
The classic first computer program
Hey there! I'm doing this at my internship at Armedia, LLC.
So far, I'm approaching the end of my third week - and I feel
like I've learned so much so far! I'm making this Github account
in the hope that I can apply to the Disney Tech Behind the Magic
Experience, although I know it's a long shot. But this Gitlab 
account will be super helpful to have anyway!
